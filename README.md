# PHISHING-URL-DETECTION-SYSTEM
This is my new phishing url detection system which uses local data as well as an AI (Gemini) to analyze if the given link is a dangerous phishing link

# BEFORE USING THE APP
It is important to know that this is a student project. Moreover, I've also hidden my API-KEY for privacy reasons.

Because of that, you need to create your own API inorder to use the application. To do so, you can click on "[GET YOUR API KEY](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)"
to generate your own api key. Then, you can replace the value of the variable called "api_key" with your own API KEY from Google and the app will run as intended.
Thank You for using the app....

# UPDATE V1.1
Previously, without the API KEY, you were unable to use the application even though it is designed for ONLINE & OFFLINE mode. But now, I've added error-checking
features, which allows it to work even if you do not possess an API KEY. However, I still reccommend you to generate your API KEY and use it for accurate solutions.
Thank You.
