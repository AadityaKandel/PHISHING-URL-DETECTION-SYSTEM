# PHISHING-URL-DETECTION-SYSTEM
This is my new phishing url detection system which uses local data as well as an AI (Gemini) to analyze if the given link is a dangerous phishing link

# BEFORE USING THE APP
It is important to know that this is a student project. Moreover, I've also hidden my API-KEY for privacy reasons.
Because of that, you need to create your own API inorder to use the application. To do so, you can head to "(GET YOUR API KEY)[https://aistudio.google.com/apikey]"
and generate your own api key. After doing that, you can simply copy the api key and replace the value of the variable, api_key="api-key" with your own api key.
Then, you'll finally be able to use the application. Thank You.
